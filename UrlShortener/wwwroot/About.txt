How does our service work?

It's very simple!

To shorten your URL, follow these steps:

Register an account.
Go to the page...
Paste your link and click the "Confirm" button.
That's it! You will immediately be redirected to a table where your original URL and the shortened URL will appear. You will also have two available functions: view and delete. It's that easy!

Enjoy using the service!
